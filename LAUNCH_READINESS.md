# Launch Readiness Record

This document is the **single gate** for production releases.
A release cannot be labelled production-ready until every blocking area below
has an approved sign-off with a link to supporting evidence.

Fill in this template for each release candidate.  Archive completed copies in
`docs/releases/LAUNCH_READINESS_<version>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`.

## How to use this document

1. Copy this template to `docs/releases/LAUNCH_READINESS_<version>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`.
2. Assign an owner to each area.
3. Each owner must complete their section, link to evidence (test reports, audit
   results, monitoring dashboards), and add their GitHub handle + date.
4. Open risks must have: owner, impact assessment, mitigation, and expiry date.
5. The release manager reviews all sections and confirms the release is unblocked.
6. This completed document is committed to the repository alongside the release tag.

**Blocking areas**: Functional, Security, Contract, Payment, Accessibility,
Performance, Privacy, Monitoring, Backup, Support.
